# Disruption and reconfiguration of relational cues

“Sa ka borë n’Pashtrik t’vogël, s’guxojmë me mjellë n’fushë.”
As long as there is snow on Little Pashtrik Mountain, we don’t plant in the fields — say farmers from Rrafshi i Dukagjinit: Muharrem Hoti, Imer Duraku, and Gazmend Daka.

Farmers use relational cues for planting: snow on the Pashtrik Mountains signals that it’s still too early to plant in open fields—the risk of late frost remains.

Even as climate shifts unsettle established seasonal patterns and disrupt relational cues, Kosovo farmers continue to organise their activities through relational rather than fixed temporal frameworks—agricultural cycles shaped by shifting ecological signals.

This erosion of stability in seasonal rhythms reveals how both long-held temporal patterns and embodied forms of ecological knowledge are being simultaneously disrupted and reconfigured.
