In spring, the apple trees don’t have ripe fruit yet — only buds, flowers, and young leaves / And then something just starts to go bad / Like when grass begins to rot / When a late frost hits these tender parts of the fruit, the cells burst, releasing plant compounds into the air / Sad but full of energy / A faint, green bitterness — like crushed leaves that are turning bad / Grass, crisp / Fermenty / Risk / For two years in a row, I lost all my apple production because of late frost. So I stopped producing apples on a large scale — now I only have a few left
