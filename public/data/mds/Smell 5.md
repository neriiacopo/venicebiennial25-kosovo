## Smell: Precursor: Stillness

## Sensed: 10.06.2022

## Told: 17.03.2025

Before the hail, there’s a deep stillness / Air humidity / Pressure drop / Harder to breathe /
When the hail is about to hit, the smell of soil is like after rain, just a little fainter  / The hail cools the soil. Unlike rain, which warms the soil / Cools the air as well. Smell of ice / There was never hail in Lipjan before. We started our agricultural activity here because, historically, there was no hail. Now, it happens every two years
