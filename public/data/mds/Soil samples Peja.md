Soil samples at Agricultural Institute of Kosovo in Peja

Five distinct soils—ranging from dark, fertile topsoils to lighter, mineral-rich layers from deeper geological strata—have been transported from Kosovo to Venice. They reveal both the embedded constraints and adaptive possibilities of a changing landscape. 

All soils used in the pavilion were sourced from discarded sites.
This research was developed in close collaboration with Kosovar soil researcher Betim Bresilla, whose expertise guided the identification, classification, and interpretation of the soils, and with Engjell Berisha, who supported the fieldwork and sourcing process on-site.
