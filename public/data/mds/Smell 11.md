## EVENT: LATE RAIN

In the chamomile field, where the soil is a bit different — heavier — when there’s more rain, when it rains for longer, and especially in recent years, the humidity rises. The smell changes when it rains, and you can sense it from far away, like chamomile mixed with mint (like Mentha spicata, the kind you find in Orbit gum), with a hint of swampiness. / When the wind blew, it came from Skopje—we used to call it Shkupja—and it always brought rain. Now we have two or three days of Shkupja, and there’s no rainfall
