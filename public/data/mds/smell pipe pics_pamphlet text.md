As climate change destabilizes familiar environmental rhythms, new forms of attunement become necessary. Emerging Assemblages’ relational calendar reframes seasonal time through a sequence of smells, representing the six ecological threshold events identified by farmers as critical stress points in agricultural cycles—late frost, new hail, early heat, late rain, early frost, and absent snow. 

Smell—our most intimate, immediate, and least abstract sense—offers a powerful medium through which to perceive, embody, and communicate ecological transformation. Smell is the language of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)—chemical signals emitted by plants, soils, microbes, and stressed crops. This chemical semiotics is not confined to human interpretation; it constitutes a shared sensory lexicon across species. 

Each smell in the relational calendar is a temporal node that traces patterns of disappearance, transformation, and persistence in Kosovo’s shifting landscapes. Unlike visual data or statistical models—which often assume distance and objectivity—smell demands proximity, requiring bodily immersion and sensory openness. Smell collapses the division between human and more-than-human worlds, offering a sensory thread through which mutual presence, stress, and adaptation are registered. The olfactory markers of the pavilion’s relational calendar do not illustrate ecological change from afar; they embody it, situating the knower within the very processes being sensed. 

As you move through the olfactory events of this calendar, the Kosovan soil on the ground of the pavilion breathes its own timeline—layered temporalities that register both the deep duration of geological formation and the immediate metabolic activities of microbial life. Here, time is not a neutral backdrop but a living, active force, palpable in breath, scent, and decay.

The relational calendar resists the abstraction of clock time. It does not chart time as fixed or universal, but as embodied—an experience of time made of thresholds, ruptures, metabolic cycles, and environmental signals. To move through it is to encounter time as lived and sensed: an unstable, more-than-human chronicle of landscapes in transition.

Through the sensory immediacy of smell and the materiality of soil, Emerging Assemblages disrupts conventional hierarchies of ecological knowledge—those that privilege the measurable over the experiential, the abstract over the embodied. It affirms that knowledge is not merely cognitive or visual, but also affective, situated, and relational. 

The relational calendar is not a predictive tool, nor an instrument of calibration, but an invitation: to dwell within ecological flux, to attune to its sensory dimensions, and to recognize our entanglement with worlds in transformation.
