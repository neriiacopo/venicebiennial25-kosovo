The smell of scorching (he refers to somborka peppers) with the  smell of mold/ The fruit of the tree, in autumn, holds its sugar. After the frost, it doesn’t spoil — there’s no smell. That’s because by this time, the fruit isn’t affected anymore. Late frost doesn’t harm them, and that’s when you don’t notice a particular smell. Peppers are the opposite. Early frost hits them hard / They’re full of water and vitamins; when damaged, the smell is strong — a mix of raw pepper and fermentation / We are devastated. We work all year for this / Wetness and rot
