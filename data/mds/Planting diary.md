## Planting diary

Over time, farmers have observed shifts in the timing of key events—planting, blooming, harvesting,  no longer follow the same cycles as they did a decade ago. For example, the planting of peppers now occurs two weeks later than before, while chamomile blooms earlier than expected. These shifting times reveal an ongoing negotiation between long-held knowledge and  emerging realities—still guided by relational cues rather than fixed calendar dates.
