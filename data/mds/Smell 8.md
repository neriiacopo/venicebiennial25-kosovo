Wheat harvest used to be after July 10. Now, we’re harvesting by June 27 or 28. In Lipjan, it’s much earlier than it used to be. Wheat will be a big problem in the future - I don’t think we will grow it anymore in Kosovo. We need wheat varieties that ripen by June 20, before the worst heat hits / Latent state / A state of stillness / The wheat gets burnt / The air becomes hard to bear / Dry air / The name of July — Korrik in Albanian — comes from the word korr, meaning harvest. But now, the harvest of wheat doesn’t happen in July anymore. It occurs at the end of June, instead of in Korrik. KORR-ik — without the korr
