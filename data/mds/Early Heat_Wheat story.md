## EVENT EARLY HEAT

## Disrupted cycles

In Albanian, Korrik (July) takes its name from korrja, the mowing of wheat.

In recent years, wheat has been harvested two weeks ahead of previous cycles, in relations to 10 years ago. Farmers speak of how 'early heat' interrupts the crop before it can mature—leaving it small, undeveloped, and unable to complete its cycle.

Wheat used to be harvested after the 10th of July. Now, the harvest takes place at the end of June or the very beginning of July.
This year, a farmer from the Lipjan area of Kosovo hoped the cycle might return to its old rhythm. But as he later reported, the wheat was already cut by July 3rd—scorched by the heat of late June.

Farmers are now searching for a Kosovo-specific wheat variety—one that can complete its growth before June heat strikes. But it doesn’t yet exist. Such a variety would take a decade to develop and test.
