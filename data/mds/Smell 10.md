Wilting / Suffocation of the pepper / The smell is closer to rot — but it’s not Botrytis. It’s more like a swamp, almost like when water dries up and leaves behind something stale / In the other town where peppers are grown, in Krusha, the soil is different. They call it zallina, a draining soil. And they don’t have this problem, even when it rains a lot. Here, we have more clay-based (argila) soil, so these events are much more problematic for us
