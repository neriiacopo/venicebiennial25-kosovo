## Aesthetics of Soil: A Temporary Knowledge

As farmers across Kosovo observe the increasing vulnerability of traditional crops, attention turns to the ground itself. One farmer noted that even the soil may no longer endure. After a certain temperature in summer, the microorganisms begin to die — they are not adapted to
such heat. “The microorganisms are not active,” he said, “and then, the soil doesn’t smell anymore.”

Installed as a geologic section — composed of successive soil horizons, from dark, biologically rich topsoil to lighter, compact, mineral-heavy deeper layers of earth — the pavilion floor reveals both the embedded constraints and the adaptive possibilities of a changing landscape. It introduces soil not as metaphor, but as method. The material was sourced from two agricultural plains in Kosovo — Rrafshi i Kosovës (the Kosovo Plain) and Rrafshi i Dukagjinit (the Dukagjini
Plain) — each carrying distinct ecological histories and localized soil formations.

More than surface, the soil functions as both ecological archive and active participant. It invokes material presence as a form of epistemology — a way of knowing through sensory experience and lived proximity. Emitting volatile compounds that mark shifting ecological thresholds, it offers not prediction, but a sensory record of breakdown. The Kosovan soil underfoot breathes its own timeline — layered temporalities that carry both the deep duration of geological
formation and the immediate metabolic rhythms of microbial life. Here, time is not a neutral backdrop but a living, active force, palpable in breath, scent, and decay.

Through the sensory immediacy and the materiality of soil, Emerging Assemblages disrupts conventional hierarchies of ecological knowledge. It affirms that knowledge is not merely cognitive or visual, but also affective, situated, and relational. The soil remembers. It registers ruptures in the present.
It enacts a counter-chronology — one that resists linear progression and instead traces the temporal instability of ecological change.
The calendar it composes is not algorithmic but atmospheric — attuned to scent, season, and the subtle shifts of breakdown.
It offers not control, but attunement.
