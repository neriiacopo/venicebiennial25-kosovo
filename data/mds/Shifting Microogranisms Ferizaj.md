When the Soil Stops Smelling: Shifting Microorganisms

Soil measurements in Ferizaj, Kosovo.

As farmers across Kosovo observe the increasing vulnerability of traditional crops, attention
turns to the ground itself. One farmer said that the soil may no longer endure. After a
certain temperature in summer, the microorganisms begin to die — they are not adapted to
such heat. “The microorganisms are not active,” he said, “and then, the soil doesn’t smell
anymore.”
