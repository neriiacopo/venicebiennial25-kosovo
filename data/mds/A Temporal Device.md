## A Temporal Device

## Transparency, Translation, Transformation, Mediation

The pavilion takes its circular, suspended form because it is built to function as a temporal device, one that follows the shifting calendar of threshold ecological moments revealed through fieldwork. A structure that receives knowledge, transforms it, and transmits it across bodies, materials, and timescales. Its architecture follows the path that the knowledge itself takes.

The project begins with the farmers in Kosovo who described, in intimate detail, the exact moments when crops but also familiar ecological cues are failing. These are stories grounded in generational, embodied knowledge, knowledge carried in seasons, smells, and soils.

From there, this knowledge enters a chain of mediations. The farmers’ sensory accounts are first translated into detailed descriptions of smell and atmosphere during these moments of rupture, forming the initial layer of transformation. These descriptions are then further refined into laboratory-based reconstructions of volatile compounds that evoke the ecological conditions described in the field. VOCs—volatile organic compounds—constitute the most widely spoken language on the planet.

The pavilion’s machinery and controlled release points visualize this process. It makes the chain of translation visible:
from landscape to memory,
from memory to description of smell,
from description of smell to chemistry,
from chemistry to installation,
from installation to visitor.

The structure carries these smells like time capsules, releasing them slowly into the space, so the visitor encounters the landscape cycle not through images or representations but through translated atmospheres. Each smell marks a moment of ecological stress, an unstable seasonal threshold, a fracture in the calendar.

By exposing the mechanics of smell production and release, the pavilion also exposes the risks of translation: the loss, distortion, and transformation that occur whenever knowledge moves through different bodies—human, chemical, architectural. Instead of hiding these mediations, the pavilion incorporates them into its form. It acknowledges that ecological knowledge does not travel unchanged; it must be translated again and again to reach other places.

Ultimately, the pavilion looks like a device because it is one — a device for carrying relational, landscape, geopolitical, agricultural, and sensory knowledge across distances. It shows what happens when embodied experience passes through different material and temporal registers, becoming atmosphere, chemistry, architecture, and finally, encounter.
