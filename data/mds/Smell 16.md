# EVENT: ABSENT SNOW
## 16
## Smell: Early Apple Blossom
## Sensed: - 
## Told: 10.04.2025

It depends on the variety, but in general, all the flowers bloom earlier in the apple varieties - 20 days earlier. This is because there is no strong winter, no snow. And then it can happen that a frost damages some of the flowers because of this early flowering. They bloom again — it happened to me in June — but the scent is weaker. And they don’t bear fruit as well. The bees and pollinators are very confused
