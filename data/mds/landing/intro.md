When familiar seasonal markers falter, how do you read a
changing landscape? Lulebora nuk çel më. Emer ging
Assemblages explores this question through a
sensory-material installation that traces the rhythms and
knowledge systems of a world in flux. Drawing from fieldwork
with farmers in Kosovo, the project follows a landscape in
transition—where traditional crops like wheat and beans
struggle, while new species like kiwi and figs begin to
emerge. The pavilion presents a relational calendar,
organised according to ecological thresholds identified as
critical points in agricultural cycles—late frost, new hail,
early heat, late rain, early frost, and absent snow.
Visitors experience each threshold event as a choreography
of smells, recreating the sensory signatures that farmers
recognize in these pivotal moments. These smells mingle with
the living exhalations of Kosovo’s soil on the pavilion
floor, creating a sensory archive of embodied knowledge in
transition: both what is being lost and what emerges as
shifting landscapes and climates reconfigure situated and
relational ways of knowing.
