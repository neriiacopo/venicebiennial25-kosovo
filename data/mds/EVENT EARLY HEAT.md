# EVENT: EARLY HEAT

Crops are not failing because of heat alone, but because that heat now arrives at the wrong time, according to farmers. Wheat needs to mature in June — but that’s precisely when intense temperatures now hit. The plants grow too quickly and remain small, unable to develop properly. The current wheat hybrid struggles under this shifted timeline. Farmers are searching for a new Kosovo-specific wheat variety that can fully mature before the heat of June arrives — one adapted not just to rising temperatures, but to their new timing. But such a variety doesn’t yet exist. It would take eight years to develop, and at least two more to test.
