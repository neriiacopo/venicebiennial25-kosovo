## More-than-human calendar

## More-than-human temporalities

Non-human entities—plants, insects, animals—navigate their environments through finely tuned ecological timings. When these timings shift, migrations no longer align with seasons, flowering no longer aligns with pollinators, and long-established cycles begin to fall out of sync.

Farmers across the region have observed that many bird species no longer migrate at the same time each year, with departures and arrivals becoming increasingly irregular or unexpectedly delayed.

These migration patterns are used by farmers to read seasonal rhythms, relate different ecological cycles, and guide land-based knowledge.

As part of the research process, farmers across Kosovo shared their intimate experiences of working with the land under increasing ecological stress. Through detailed conversations, they identified key moments in the agricultural cycle when crops falter or fail—threshold events such as late frost, early frost, sudden hail, or absent snow. Moments when crops hesitate, fail, adapt, or transform. These critical turning points, deeply felt and remembered through the senses, form the foundation of the pavilion’s relational calendar.

As a continuation of this work, two white storks born in Prizren, named Sharr and Pashtrik, become active participants in tracing these shifting ecologies. Their seasonal movements, now monitored through GPS tracking, extend the relational calendar beyond the agricultural field. Following an understanding of sensing as a distributed, multispecies practice, the storks emerge as more-than-human knowledge producers. Their changing routes, delays, hesitations, and departures mirror broader ecological disruptions, offering new ways of understanding how both human and non-human temporalities are shifting.

This work was made possible through a collaboration between curator and exhibitor Erze Dinarama with Qendra Kosovare për Edukim dhe Hulumtim Mjedisor – KEERC; Shoqata Ornitologjike Kosovare – KOS; and wildlife photographers Liridon Shala and Blerim Gjoci. It was supported by the Max Planck Institute in Germany, which provided the GPS devices, rings, and monitoring platform for the white storks, as well as by the Ministry of Environment, Spatial Planning, and Infrastructure in Kosovo.
