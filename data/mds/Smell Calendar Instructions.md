# Smell Calendar Instructions

## How to Engage with the Relational Calendar?

The installation represents a relational calendar, organized around ecological thresholds.

The calendar is experienced through time-based release:
– Smells are emitted two at a time, each pair remaining active for up to 10 seconds.
– A brief 4-second pause follows before the next pair is released.
– The sequence unfolds over 112 seconds, completing one full atmospheric cycle.

To engage:
The smells are not visible, but some are signaled by the appearance of smoke. You might wait for smoke to appear, and begin there.
Let the cycle unfold. Don’t rush.
Wait for the smells to arrive; they will come to you.
Attend to the slow, almost imperceptible rhythms that shape the land and those who live with it.

This calendar privileges presence over prediction, and proximity over distance, inviting you into an embodied encounter with ecological time.
