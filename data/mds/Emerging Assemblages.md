Through fieldwork with Kosovo farmers, the project bears witness to a landscape in transition, as agricultural traditions encounter and adapt to new ecological realities. Shifting climate zones and changing seasonal rhythms have disrupted familiar environmental signals, putting situated, embodied forms of ecological knowledge at risk. At the same time, this uncertainty gives rise to new assemblages of human and non-human actors, knowledge practices, and material relations that emerge in response to altered ecological conditions. In these moments of systemic uncertainty, both the fragility and adaptability of existing knowledge arrangements is exposed.

Emerging Assemblages proposes a radical intimacy with a world in transformation, encouraging forms of sensory attunement that render perceptible the otherwise elusive dynamics of environmental change. As traditional ecological cues fragment in the face of climate change, it considers how we might cultivate deeper forms of entanglement—ways of knowing that blur the distinction between subject and environment, between knower and known.
Between scientific prediction and lived experience lies a productive gap—a space where those with hands in soil become interpreters of changing landscapes, developing new ways of reading and responding to ecological cues. For these farmers, knowing how to navigate shifting landscapes comes not from the detached observation privileged in scientific paradigms, but from intimate forms of sensory engagement. Knowing the land is a matter of making sense; sensory entanglements offering locally nuanced and immediate data that predictive models cannot capture.

Emerging Assemblages invites an encounter with smell as a form of ecological knowledge. Smell is our most proximal and intimate sense. Unlike vision or hearing, smell demands bodily co-presence; it resists disembodiment and evades the simplifications of quantification or digital translation. It offers a mode of ecological perception grounded in bodily proximity and affective charge.

At the heart of the pavilion, a relational calendar captures the hyperlocal, unstable rhythms of Kosovo’s changing agricultural landscape through a sequence of translated smells. Each smell was distilled from farmers’ sensory descriptions of stress points in the agricultural cycle, alchemically recreating experiences otherwise inaccessible across temporal and cultural distance.
These smells mingle with the living smellscape of the pavilion floor: a geological section of dark, fertile topsoil and lighter, mineral-rich earth transported from Kosovo’s agricultural plains. More than mere surface, this soil acts as both ecological archive and active participant, contributing its own aromatic vocabulary to the sensory assemblage of this calendar. Together, these elements form a complex choreography: smells that emerge from narrated experiences of ecological rupture merging with the continuous exhalations of living soil.

The smells of this relational calendar are both aesthetic phenomena and critical sensory archive, carrying the latent histories and speculative futures of ecological change. Smell— intimately tied to the chemical life of soil, of plants, of atmospheric change—becomes a conduit for perceiving and feeling ecological change; immediate, affective, and irreducible. Each scent encountered becomes a temporal node—a trace of disappearing agricultural cycles, fading seasonal markers, and nascent ecosystems reshaped by climate volatility. In attuning to them, Emerging Assemblages invites us to rethink our modes of ecological perception—not as distant observers, but as implicated participants in an unstable, co-constituted world.

Emerging Assemblages positions sensory engagement as a generative response to epistemological rupture—moments when dominant systems of knowledge fail, making space for new configurations of human and non-human relations to emerge. Where predictive models falter—reliant on quantifiable data and linear temporality—soil and smell insist on ways of knowing shaped by proximity, bodily entanglement, and the unruly sensory signals of a changing world.
