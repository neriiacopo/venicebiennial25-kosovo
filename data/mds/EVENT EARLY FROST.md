## EVENT: EARLY FROST

Early frost, which traditionally occurred in October, now happens in November. It used to be a reliable seasonal marker, indicating transitions in the agricultural calendar. Farmers mention that in the past, softer frosts would appear first, serving as a signal that a heavier frost was coming. These warnings are gone — the frost either arrives late and all at once, or not at all.
