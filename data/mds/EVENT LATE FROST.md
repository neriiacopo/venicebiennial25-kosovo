## EVENT: LATE FROST

Farmers relate the planting in the open field to the late frost. It is one of the most critical thresholds in their calendar—a marker that signals when they can safely plant, and when the season truly begins. They claim that because frost has shifted in time, all of their agricultural activities have shifted too—since so many decisions are timed in relation to it. Spring, once a season of gradual transition, now begins with an early period of warmth that triggers blooming, followed by a late cold. This shift gives mixed signals to plants, pollinators and farmers alike. Historically, the last frost was anticipated through ecological cues: snow still on the mountains, or the moment the sky cleared after several days of rain. These signs no longer hold.

Frost begins forming just a few centimeters above the ground—hyperlocal and difficult to detect with standard instruments. It is recorded through observation.

To describe the frost, farmers speak of it not as a single event, but as a sequence of sensations—the freshness in the air before, the stillness during, and the impact on their crops after.
Medih Bresilla, a farmer in Kosovo, removed several hectares of apples in 2017 and 2018 after losing two consecutive harvests to late frost. Most recently, on April 5, 6, and 7 of 2025, a late frost destroyed all the buds on his pear and apple trees. He now says that there will be no apples from Kosovo this year—only imports.
