Desert / Emptiness / Solid phase / Freshness /Stillness / Cold in the air / The plants are tired, aged, almost finished. / Their smell is weaker compared to spring / All the plants are worn out. They’re nearly done / There’s less smell before the frost, unlike in spring. / Silence / Not much smell before. But when frost comes, nothingness. / The frost kills all scent. What’s left is a heavy stillness, the smell of ice
