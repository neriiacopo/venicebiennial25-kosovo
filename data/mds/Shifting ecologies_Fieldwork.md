## Shifting ecologies

Through fieldwork with farmers in Kosovo, the project bears witness to a landscape in transition, as agricultural traditions encounter and adapt to new ecological realities. Shifting climate zones and changing seasonal rhythms have disrupted familiar environmental signals, putting situated, embodied forms of ecological knowledge at risk.

The fieldwork was conducted with farmers who have, for generations, cultivated traditional crops that are now increasingly perceived as failing. The project seeks to record — and to represent through sensory experience — this intimate moment in which crops begin to falter. It traces the deep, lived relationship between farmers and their land. They describe these moments through smell.
