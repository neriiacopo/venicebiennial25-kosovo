# Mixed signals

Non-human entities—plants, insects, animals—navigate their environments through finely tuned ecological timings. When these timings shift, migrations no longer align with seasons, flowering no longer aligns with pollinators, and long-established cycles begin to fall out of sync.

Farmers across the region have observed that many bird species no longer migrate at the same time each year, with departures and arrivals becoming increasingly irregular or unexpectedly delayed.

These migration patterns are used by farmers to read seasonal rhythms, relate different ecological cycles, and guide land-based knowledge.
